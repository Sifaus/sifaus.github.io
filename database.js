Successes in favor of the Expunger mean a trait is removed for each success over the obstacle. The victim’s Will is taxed by one die for each trait removed. Traits removed should be the earliest/oldest acquired during the player’s adventures (a good reason to mark down imprinted traits in order), or the needs of the narrative may point to the proper traits. If stuck, the GM may roll the DoF for each trait in sequence down the list until a 1 comes up - that trait is removed, and the rolling begins from the top until the necessary number of traits have been scratched off.<br>A player may forfeit the roll if they wish to cleanse their character’s palate of traits, but they still suffer the tax.<br>Taxed dice are only lost temporarily and recovered through downtime or at the GM’s discretion. Exponent loss if Will is taxed below zero (into the negatives) is permanent: in other words, that Imago character forever loses one die of Will for each die taxed in excess of their current Will at the time of Amelioration. If the Imago has a Grey shade will, count their Will as being 2 dice higher. If White, count it as four higher. If their Will is reduced to exactly zero, no less, they do not lose any dice but all of their imprinted traits are written off. <br>If this permanent reduction reduces the Imago’s unmodified Will to 3 or less, they acquire the Burnout trait. If it reduces their unmodified Will to zero permanently, they wither away into a wisp.<br>A versus test in the victim’s favor mean that they have successfully held on. Will is taxed by one die only and only a single trait is removed due to the nastiness of the experience. Player’s choice of trait.
