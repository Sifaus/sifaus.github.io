Successes in favor of the Expunger mean a trait is removed for each success over the obstacle. The victim’s Will is taxed by one die for each trait removed. Traits removed should be the earliest/oldest acquired during the player’s adventures (a good reason to mark down imprinted traits in order), or the needs of the narrative may point to the proper traits. If stuck, the GM may roll the DoF for each trait in sequence down the list until a 1 comes up - that trait is removed, and the rolling begins from the top until the necessary number of traits have been scratched off.<br>A player may forfeit the roll if they wish to cleanse their character’s palate of traits, but they still suffer the tax.<br>Taxed dice are only lost temporarily and recovered through downtime or at the GM’s discretion. Exponent loss if Will is taxed below zero (into the negatives) is permanent: in other words, that Imago character forever loses one die of Will for each die taxed in excess of their current Will at the time of Amelioration. If the Imago has a Grey shade will, count their Will as being 2 dice higher. If White, count it as four higher.

Any of the items or materials he creates via a skill song can be imbued with the power of a spell song. An artisan who wishes to enchant an item, must first create it with a skill song like Jewelcraft, Riddle of Steel, or Weaving Way. Once the item is created, the spell song must be sung. The singer has one chance to transfer his power. The song is sung according to its rules, but the effect generated is imbued into the item, and active whenever the item is used. No enchantment will hold unless the structure is of highest quality. Any item created by any skill song can be used. However, whether it's a shoe or a crown, the base obstacle to create the item is 5. If the obstacle would naturally be higher, use that instead.
