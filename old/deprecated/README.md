# yigitlevent.github.io - a roleplaying... thing.
I always wanted to make a Burning Wheel Gold Revised tool that would help with the character creation and all that. So here it is.

## Features
* Explore lifepaths, skills and traits.
* Change settings, or add user-made content in.
* A character burner that can be used to quickly create a character.
* Character questions and ability to change appropriate weapons.
* Maybe some features which I forgot to list here.

## How to Use
Either go to the yigitlevent.github.io, or download the repository and run index.html file.

## Bugs, Typos, Wrong Entries, User-Made Content
You can modify, download, or do whatever with this. I'd be grateful for any help, although it is a mess so i don't expect anyone to care or bother with it. If you want to let me know of something or if you want me to add something, just open an issue. Same goes for bugs and all that.

## Database, Optimization
Yeah, its a big fat mess; but it works. Older phones struggle with it a bit when user tries to change settings and all that, but other than that it should be okay. Further optimization will be a priority as soon as possible.

## Credits
Check the "Observer" tab. Full credits and everything else is explained there, i think. I'm not sure.
